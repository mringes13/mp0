## MP0
MP0 is a simple application that pings desired websites, as defined by the user, using Go-Routines and Go-Channels. 
This project was assigned to practice the newly learned Go-Routines and Go-Channels.

## How to Run
### Step 1: Initialize ping of websites
Start the analytical ping with `go run mastping.go`
### Step 2: Interact with Command Line

#### User Ping Websites Process
- To quit the program when being asked to input websites, return 'q'.
- To quit the program while running, interact with the system command line (i.e. OS Terminal - Control + C)
- Enter the desired websites to be pinged.
